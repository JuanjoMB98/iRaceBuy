The third-mile clay oval has played host to the World of Outlaws almost every year since 1987, and frequently attracts some of the biggest names in the sport - even ones who don't normally make their living on the dirt - to compete. The track features 19 degrees of banking in the corners and 10 degrees on its straightaways.</p> <p>I-55 was purchased by NASCAR legend and Missouri native Ken Schrader in 2003, and fellow Missourian Kenny Wallace is a mainstay of the track as well. In May 2020, shortly after staging one of the first real-world racing events in America after the COVID-19 pandemic began, Kyle Larson set the track record and broke the 10-second mark in a World of Outlaws Sprint Car. Now's your chance to see if you can match that kind of speed in the virtual world.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/federatedautopartsracewayati55","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"federatedautopartsraceway-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/federatedautopartsraceway-logo.png","north":"90deg","num_svg_images":8,"small_image":"federatedautopartsraceway-small.jpg","track_id":438,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_pevely/438-pevely/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
