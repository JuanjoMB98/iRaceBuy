As with so many of America's premier dirt ovals, the track was built out of former farmland—in this case, a soybean field—and has hosted many of the top national series in the country, including the World of Outlaws Sprint Car Series. After a brief stint as the Badlands Motor Speedway in the mid-2010s and subsequent closure, the track was rescued in the summer of 2020 by Tod Quiring, who returned top-level sprint car racing to the South Dakota circuit quickly thereafter.</p> <p>Huset's Speedway measures in as a high-banked, 1/3 mile bullring. It typically hosts both weekly and national level racing through Labor Day weekend. The Huset's High Bank Nationals and Huset's Hustle for sprint cars each offer six-figure payouts to their winners, while the Silver Dollar Nationals pay $75,000 to win for top late model racers. Adding to the track's prestige, Quiring also prominently displays the Huset's brand on his Big Game Motorsports 410 Sprint Car on the World of Outlaws national tour, where he and driver David Gravel have teamed up for dozens of checkered flags in recent seasons.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/husetsspeedway","gallery_images":"1,2,3","gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"husetsspeedway-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/husetsspeedway-logo.png","north":"90deg","num_svg_images":5,"small_image":"husetsspeedway-small.jpg","track_id":531,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_husets/531-husets/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
