{"coordinates":"45.1905140,-92.5892520","detail_copy":"<p>Home of The Masters and the USA Nationals, Cedar Lake Speedway is one of the premier circuits on the World of Outlaws Morton Buildings Late Model Series schedule. \"Wisconsin's Fastest Piece of Real Estate\" is a .375-mile clay oval based in New Richmond, Wisconsin, that broke ground in 1956 and opened the very next year. The track was conceived after farmer Elmer Cook remarked that the natural bowl in the swamp on his farm property would make a perfect racetrack, and after just three weeks of roughed out work, the track began to take shape.</p>\r\n<p>Since then, Cedar Lake has come a long way from its humble beginnings, which saw 85 spectators watch 12 cars at its first event. Today, it's home to marquee events like the World of Outlaws USA Nationals, The Masters, Legendary 100, and more. Whether sprint cars, late models, or modifieds are your preference, you’ll find Cedar Lake’s clay surface to be as fun as it gets to drive.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/cedarlakespeedway","gallery_images":"1,2,3","gallery_prefix":"cedarlakespeedway-gallery.jpg","large_image":"cedarlakespeedway-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/cedarlakespeedway-logo.png","north":"160deg","num_svg_images":5,"small_image":"cedarlakespeedway-small.jpg","track_id":387,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_cedarlake/387-cedarlake/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
