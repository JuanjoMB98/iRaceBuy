{"coordinates":"43.0595560,-76.5469060","detail_copy":"<p>The flagship track of the Super DIRTCar Series, Weedsport Speedway was born in the 1950s when, at the urging of his wife Irene, Stan Dudzinski carved a third-mile dirt oval into a berry patch. The track opened to its first competitive event in 1955 and, following its sale to new owners, was converted to a new, 3/8-mile layout in time for the 1970s. A decade later, promoters began booking some of the biggest acts in music to play at the track, ushering in a new era for live music in central New York and cementing the track's status as the place to be in the summer.</p><p>\r\nIn the modern era, big block modifieds continue to rule the track, but the World of Outlaws NOS Energy Sprint Car World Championship and USAC National Sprint Car Championship are among the other national series that also make annual visits to Weedsport. Combine that with a deep slate of local and regional competitors in all types of vehicles, and no matter when you turn up to the track, chances are youâ€™ll get to see some of the best dirt racers in America do their thing.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/weedsportspeedway","gallery_images":"1,2,3","gallery_prefix":"weedsportspeedway-gallery.jpg","large_image":"weedsportspeedway-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/weedsportspeedway-logo.png","north":"160deg","num_svg_images":7,"small_image":"weedsportspeedway-small.jpg","track_id":373,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_weedsport/373-weedsport/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
