The half-mile track has long played host to weekly events for classes ranging from hobby, stock, and late models to premier 410 Sprint Cars. Its signature sprint car event, the Tuscarora 50, has been a staple of the track's annual schedule for half a century; Lance Dewease has taken the checkered flag in the big money race a record seven times as of 2022, and legends of the sport like Dave Blaney, Greg Hodnett, and Doug Wolfgang have also taken Tuscarora victories.</p> <p>Port Royal made its World of Outlaws debut in the series' second season in 1979, and was an on and off member of the schedule until returning to annual status in 2014. Lynn Paxton took the first Sprint Car win in WoO history, and names like Donny Schatz, Brad Sweet, and Kyle Larson have also earned victories in series events at Port Royal. WoO's Late Model division made its debut at the track in 2007 and now visits the track each year as well.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/portroyalspeedway","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"portroyalspeedway-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/portroyalspeedway-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":7,"small_image":"portroyalspeedway-small.jpg","track_id":446,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_portroyal/446-portroyal/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
