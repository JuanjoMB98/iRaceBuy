Originally a 12-turn, 4.556-km (2.832-mile) circuit, the GP-Strecke was revamped in 2002 with the replacement of the Castrol Chicane by the Haug-Hook right hander and subsequent omega-shaped Mercedes Arena turn, bringing the circuit to its current 16-turn, 5.148-km (3.199-mile) specification. Along with the parabolic Dunlop-Kehre, the track's signature section is the Michael Schumacher S formed by Turns 9-10.</p>\n<p>The GP-Strecke was the home of the German Grand Prix and/or the European Grand Prix between 1984 and 2006 and, subsequently, alternated with Hockenheim as site of the German GP until the race was dropped from the F1 calendar altogether in 2015. The track continues to host rounds of the German Touring Car Championship, GT World Challenge, and, in combination with the remaining Nordschleife, the 24 Hours of the N端rburgring.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/nurburgring","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"nurburgringgrandprixstrecke-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/nurburgring-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":9,"small_image":"nurburgringgrandprixstrecke-small.jpg","track_id":261,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_nurburgring_gp/261-nurburgring-mullenbachschleife/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
