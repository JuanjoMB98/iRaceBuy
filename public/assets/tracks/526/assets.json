{"coordinates":"50.4369118,5.9698560","detail_copy":"<p>Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps is one of the motorsport world's most storied venues. The home of the Belgian Grand Prix, the 24 Hours of Spa and the Spa 1000K, Spa has long been recognized as a supreme test of courage and skill, and its roll call of winners reads like a history of Grand Prix and sports car racing.</p> <p>Spa has seen many variations over the years. Designed in 1920, the circuit originally ran for some 15km over public roads in Belgium's Ardennes region. The elimination of a hairpin turn in the valley of Eau Rouge creek later shortened the circuit by about a kilometer and added to its already fearsome speeds. Those speeds peaked in the early 1970s, when Pedro Rodriguez won the 1970 Belgian Grand Prix at an average speed of 149.941 mph and Henri Pescarolo set a lap record of 163.086 mph during the 1973 Spa 100K.</p> <p>Owing to safety concerns, the circuit was reconfigured to its current layout in the 1980s, and continues to evolve to this day. The revised circuit retains much of the flavor of the original course, and many of its signature turns including La Source, Blanchimont and the daunting Eau Rouge. iRacers who purchase Spa will receive not only our most modern scan of the circuit, but also the original version built in 2010, as a single package.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/circuitdespafrancorchamps","gallery_images":"1,2,3","gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"circuitdespafrancorchamps-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/circuitdespafrancorchamps-logo.png","north":"90deg","num_svg_images":6,"small_image":"circuitdespafrancorchamps-small.jpg","track_id":526,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_spa/526-spa-2024-bike/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
