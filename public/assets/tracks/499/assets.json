It quickly became host to major sports car events, lower-level open-wheel series, and grand prix motorcycle racing, for which it has hosted the Italian motorcycle Grand Prix for the past 30 years. In the COVID-19 impacted 2020 World Driver's Championship, it hosted the series for the first time with the Tuscan Grand Prix.</p> <p>Mugello features two layouts: its 3.259-mile, 15-turn Grand Prix layout, and a 1.4-mile Short configuration. Both start with its lengthy front straightaway and go into the 180-degree San Donato right-hander before heading into Luco and Poggio Secco. The track has been owned by Scuderia Ferrari since 1988, which uses it for both testing and the Ferrari Challenge Finali Mondiali; the Tuscan Grand Prix in 2020 marked its 1000th Grand Prix event.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/mugello","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"mugello-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/mugello-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":5,"small_image":"mugello-small.jpg","track_id":499,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_mugello/499-mugello-short/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
