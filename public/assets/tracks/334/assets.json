The stadium-style course was built in 2008, and made its LOORRS debut two years later. The five-turn layout features a mix of sweeping corners, high-flying jumps, and full-throttle straightaways. Firebird is also the only track on the LOORRS calendar to feature Pro 4 and Pro 2 trucks on the track at the same time, as the season-ending Lucas Oil Challenge Cup offers a five-figure grand prize to the fastest racer in short course.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/wildhorse","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"wildhorse-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/wildhorse-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":5,"small_image":"wildhorse-small.jpg","track_id":334,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_wildhorse/334-wildhorse/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
