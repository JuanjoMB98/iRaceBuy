But none of that would've been possible without the opening of Wheatland Raceway as a 3/8 mile dirt oval located in a former agricultural field in 2001. Three years later, Lucas Oil purchased the facility and rebuilt it, renovating both the track and its surrounding amenities to become one of the premier facilities in the country.</p><p>\r\nKnown as \"The Diamond of Race Tracks,\" the centerpiece clay-surface dirt oval remains unchanged in length from its original opening. With VIP luxury suites and a giant HD screen on site, fans attending races at Lucas Oil Speedway are treated to an on-site experience unlike most other dirt tracks in the nation. Hosting both national and weekly local events, only the best sprint car, late model, midget, and modified talent in the country is able to say they've taken the checkered flag in Wheatland.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/lucasoilspeedway","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"lucasoilspeedway-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/lucasoilspeedway-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":7,"small_image":"lucasoilspeedway-small.jpg","track_id":452,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_wheatland/452-wheatland/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
