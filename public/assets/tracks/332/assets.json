With a stunning mountain backdrop, it's one of the most visually unique tracks in short course, with a track layout to match. Wild West features four turns, two of which are proper hairpins, with four tabletop jumps, a massive drop-off jump after Turn 1, and a rhythm section before Turn 2 all designed to get the trucks into the air. Located just 10 minutes outside of Reno, it's a great place to watch a race-and an even more exciting track to drive with iRacing's new Pro 4 and Pro 2 builds!</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/wildwest","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"wildwest-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/wildwest-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":7,"small_image":"wildwest-small.jpg","track_id":332,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_wildwest/332-wildwest-full/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
