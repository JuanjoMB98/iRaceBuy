Originally, organizers had wanted a street circuit, similar to Monaco; while a permanent circuit became the eventual choice, the track features a number of tight and challenging corners that make it polarizing among drivers.</p><p>In its more than 30-year history, the track has crowned two Driver's World Champions and four Constructor's World Champions at its events. It's also the site of numerous firsts, including four first-time F1 winners and the first drivers from both Hungary and Poland to compete in the series. The Hungaroring has also added various sports car, touring car, motorcycle, and open wheel feeder series to its portfolio along the way, with a regular premier touring car event supplementing the schedule for more than a decade.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/hungaroring","gallery_images":"1,2,3","gallery_prefix":"hungaroring-gallery.jpg","large_image":"hungaroring-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/hungaroring-logo.png","north":"160deg","num_svg_images":11,"small_image":"hungaroring-small.jpg","track_id":413,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_hungaroring/413-hungaroring/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
