{"coordinates":"36.1332740,-95.9437210","detail_copy":"<p>Located at the Tulsa Expo Center in Oklahoma, racers from around the country across multiple disciplines come together to bear witness to what has been dubbed the 'Super Bowl of midget racing'. The Chili Bowl Midget Nationals is a prestigious dirt racing event that has seen the likes of Tony Stewart, Kasey Kahne, Christopher Bell, Kyle Larson, Rico Abreu, and the Swindell family fill the grids.</p><p>The inaugural Chili Bowl was organized by Lanny Edwards and partner Emmett Hahn. It was named after a local company who sponsored the first event. The race has been hosted at the Tulsa Expo Center since it was founded in 1987. The inaugural 1987 event consisted of 52 midgets competing in the 2-day event. The event now consists of four days of qualifiers for the Saturday night A-main event.</p><p>The Chili Bowl's key ingredient is the clay which once covered the adjacent fairgrounds. Without sun or wind to harm it, the indoor garden (roughly a quarter-mile circle) is heavily saturated so that the boldest dirt track artists of our time can truly shine. It accommodates over two hundred race rigs, bleachers for thousands of people and an ever-growing trade show. To stroll the aisles of Tulsa's QuikTrip Center, the home of The Golden Driller, is to rub shoulders with champions from across America.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/chilibowl","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"chilibowl-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/chilibowl-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":8,"small_image":"chilibowl-small.jpg","track_id":331,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_chilibowl/331-chilibowl/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
