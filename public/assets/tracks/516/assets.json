{"coordinates":"42.559206, -2.168074","detail_copy":"<p>Opened in 2010 and hosting premier car and motorcycle events ever since, Circuito de Navarra is one of Spain's top road racing circuits. From endurance events like the 24H Series, to sprint events for GT1 cars and TCR Spain, to a regular presence in the FIA F4 Spanish Championship, both sports cars and open-wheelers have taken full advantage of the track located just outside of Los Arcos. All iRacers are able to race Navarra as an included part of their subscription.</p> <p>Like many other circuits around the world, Navarra boasts three configurations: the primary 15-turn Speed Circuit that runs for 2.44 miles, and two shorter ones (the 1.66-mile Medium and 0.82-mile Short layouts) comprised of smaller segments of the track. Its long frontstretch features a gentle right-hand first corner before funneling drivers into sharper Turns 2 and 3. Many of Navarra's corners are sharply angled, with Turns 5, 7, and 10 of the primary layout the most sweeping of the group.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/navarra","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"navarra-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/navarra-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":5,"small_image":"navarra-small.jpg","track_id":516,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_navarra/516-navarra-speedmedium/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
