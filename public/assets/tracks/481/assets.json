Headlined by the 2.5-mile Willow Springs Raceway, also known as \"Big Willow,\" the facility opened in November 1953, making it the oldest permanent road course in America; in 1996, it was also declared a California Point of Historical Interest.</p> <p>\"Big Willow\" features challenging elevation changes, technical corners, and one of the most picturesque backgrounds of any circuit in the west. The nine-turn layout begins with a hard left-hander coming off of the long frontstretch, but it also features multiple long, sweeping right-handers and a tricky complex comprising Turns 3 through 5. The track has hosted everything from the NASCAR Cup Series in the 1950s to budget-level endurance racing in modern times. It's also beloved among the amateur racing community for producing exciting racing with an approachable but fun layout.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/willowspringsraceway","gallery_images":"1,2,3","gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"willowspringsraceway-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/willowspringsraceway-logo.png","north":"90deg","num_svg_images":11,"small_image":"willowspringsraceway-small.jpg","track_id":481,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_willow/481-willow-international/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
