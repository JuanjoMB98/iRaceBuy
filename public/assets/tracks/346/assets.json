Many of the world's top race drivers have found themselves atop the podium at the unique circuit, including Michael Schumacher, who won the race a record six times, including four in a row from 2001-2004.</p><p>\r\nThe track requires drivers and teams to be on their A game at all times, as wind and weather can dramatically affect the strength of a given setup or tire compound. Barcelona mixes a long, fast front straightaway with flowing curves early in the lap and a number of heavy braking and even blind corners before heading back to the finish line.
