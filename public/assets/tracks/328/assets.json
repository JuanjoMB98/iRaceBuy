There are two main configurations, Course 1000 and Course 2000, with multiple variations of both. This makes the track a perfect fit for the iRacing base package as it can be used in multiple series without becoming repetitive.</p><p>Course 2000 is just over 2 KM in length and features 14 turns. Course 1000 is approximately 1 KM and has 11 turns. While the two main configurations share the same facilities, they are completely independent of each other and don't share any racing surface.</p><p>The tracks proximity to Tokyo, Japan has made it extremely popular with local car tuners who compete in Time Attack competitions.
