If they've got a kid who wants to race, too, you've definitely seen it. Whether it's midgets, micro sprints, or box stocks, the midweek entry lists are typically packed with talent at the miniature dirt oval that sits just half an hour away from Charlotte Motor Speedway.</p> <p>Millbridge is currently owned and operated by the Burnett factory, who first became involved with the track in 2011. Their efforts have taken the quarter-mile bullring from nearly becoming a \"lost speedway\" to cult status among those who know it well. For the true Millbridge experience, be sure to take the Dirt Micro Sprint out for a spin, and you'll see just why it's such a beloved track among its regulars.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/millbridge","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"millbridge-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/millbridge-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":0,"small_image":"millbridge-small.jpg","track_id":513,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_millbridge/513-millbridge/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
