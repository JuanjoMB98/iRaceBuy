From Off-Road Motorsports Hall of Famers like Walker Evans and Rob MacCachren, to legendary off-road dynasties like the Greaves, LeDuc, and Crandon's own Flannery families, only the best of the best have secured World Cup wins at Crandon.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/crandoninternationalraceway","gallery_images":"1,2,3","gallery_prefix":"crandoninternationalraceway-gallery.jpg","large_image":"crandoninternationalraceway-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/crandoninternationalraceway-logo.png","north":"160deg","num_svg_images":9,"small_image":"crandoninternationalraceway-small.jpg","track_id":383,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_crandon/383-crandon-short/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
