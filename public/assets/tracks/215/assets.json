{"coordinates":"39.1154928,-94.8328544","detail_copy":"<p>Among the world's most modern motorsports facilities, Kansas Speedway opened for business in 2001 some 15 miles west of Kansas City, KS under the ownership of the International Speedway Corporation. Originally consisting of a 1.5 mile tri-oval with uniform (15 degrees) banking, the facility underwent a major revamp in 2012 that resulted in progressive banking of the oval (17-20 degress) along with the addition of a six turn, 2.37 mile road course incorporating a twisty infield section and all but a few hundred feet of the oval. The facility has permanent seating for 72,000 spectators along with a hotel/casino featuring more than 100,000 sq ft of gaming space.</p> <p>Kansas Speedway has hosted a variety of motorsports events over the years, including all three of the top NASCAR series, ARCA, IndyCar and the GRAND-AM Sports Car Series which utilizes the road course. Lighting was completed in 2011 but ARCA is the only organization scheduling night races at Kansas Speedway; however, the lighting is available to enable timely completion of races in the event of weather delays.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/kansasspeedway","gallery_images":"1,2,3","gallery_prefix":"kansasspeedway-gallery","large_image":"kansasspeedway-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/kansasspeedway-logo.png","north":"90deg","num_svg_images":5,"small_image":"kansasspeedway-small.jpg","track_id":215,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_kansas/215-kansas-full/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
