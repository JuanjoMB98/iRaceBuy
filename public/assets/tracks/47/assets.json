{"coordinates":"36.5842902,-121.7556574","detail_copy":"<p>WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca is one of the classic North American road-racing circuits. A serpentine ribbon of pavement winding through the hills of Northern California's Monterey Peninsula, \"Laguna\" is the site of one of the most unique and famous corners in motorsport - The Corkscrew. Approached from a long, fast uphill run, the Corkscrew is a blind, plunging lefthander that is more akin to a ski slope than a piece of race track.</p><p>Originally built by the Army Corps of Engineers on a corner of what was then Fort Ord, Laguna Seca opened in 1957 and in its half-century of operation has been host to every significant North American road-racing series, from the legendary Can-Am to the Trans-Am, IMSA Camel GT and CART Indy cars. Today a part of the Monterey County park system, Mazda Raceway at Laguna Seca hosts the Champ Car World Series, Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series, American Le Mans Series, Rolex Monterey Historic Automobile Races and is the West Coast home of the Skip Barber Racing School. In addition, the track hosts two of America's most important motorcycle races, the Red Bull U.S. Grand Prix, a round of the MotoGP World Championship and the Corona AMA Superbike Finale, the final round in America's premier motorcycle road-racing series.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/mazdaracewaylagunaseca","gallery_images":"1,2,3","gallery_prefix":"mazdaracewaylagunaseca-gallery","large_image":"mazdaracewaylagunaseca-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/weathertechracewaylagunaseca-logo.png","north":"90deg","num_svg_images":6,"small_image":"mazdaracewaylagunaseca-small.jpg","track_id":47,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_lagunaseca/47-lagunaseca/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
