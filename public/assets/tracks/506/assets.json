{"coordinates":"43.3405790,-88.2773290","detail_copy":"<p>Known as the \"World's Fastest Quarter Mile Oval,\" Slinger, Wisconsin's Slinger Speedway is the quintessential bullring short track. Opened in 1948, its defining characteristic is its high-banked corners, which reach an imposing 33 degrees on each end. That steep banking allows racers to post blazing fast laps, including Jeff Bloom's 9.908-second time in 2010-the first quarter-mile oval lap record in history to break the 10-second barrier.</p> <p>Formerly a flat, clay track, Slinger was reconfigured for the 1974 season into its current paved and high-banked state. Its most famous race each year is the Slinger Nationals, a 200-lap Super Late Model race that has been won by some of the biggest names in short track racing and NASCAR alike; former Cup Series champion Matt Kenseth holds the record with eight wins between 1994 and 2019. Slinger also has a paved X running through its center to host Figure 8 events.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/slinger","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"slinger-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/slinger-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":0,"small_image":"slinger-small.jpg","track_id":506,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_slinger/506-slinger-figure8/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
