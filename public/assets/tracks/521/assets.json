The original Sachsenring circuit spanned more than five miles through public roads, but stopped hosting races in 1990. The modern layout began to take shape in the mid-1990s. After the unification of West and East Germany, a new permanent facility was constructed, and the track received multiple tweaks until settling into its current form in 2003.</p> <p>The modern Sachsenring runs for 2.281 miles with 13 turns. The first, the Coca-Cola Kurve, sends drivers into a rapid-fire set of six round and sweeping corners. After Turn 6, the track begins to open up with more gradual curves until a tight final corner sends drivers back onto the frontstretch.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/sachsenring","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"sachsenring-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/sachsenring-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":5,"small_image":"sachsenring-small.jpg","track_id":521,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_sachsenring/521-sachsenring/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
