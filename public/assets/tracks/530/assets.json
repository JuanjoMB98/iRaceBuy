{"coordinates":"53.3102740,-0.0593990","detail_copy":"<p>Established in 1934 and taking its current shape in 1961, Lincolnshire, England's Cadwell Park has a long history of hosting both motorcycle and car racing. While its narrow width makes it an infrequent host of four-wheel racing above the club level, its British Superbike event is the premier event in that series, and British Superkart also visits the circuit regularly.</p> <p>Cadwell Park boasts four layouts: the 2.175-mile Full Circuit, a Moto variant that debuted in 2004 after MotorSport Vision purchased the track, and two shorter Club and Woodlands configurations. The full layout features numerous hills and crests through its 18 turns, with the most famous segment, “The Mountain,” often launching racers into the air as a natural jump.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/cadwell","gallery_images":"1,2,3","gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"cadwell-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/cadwell-logo.png","north":"90deg","num_svg_images":5,"small_image":"cadwell-small.jpg","track_id":530,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_cadwell/530-cadwell-woodlands/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
