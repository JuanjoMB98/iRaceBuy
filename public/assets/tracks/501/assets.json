Opened in 1972, it has seen a handful of reconfigurations in its half-century of operation, most recently settling on its current 4.226 km (2.626 mile) Grand Prix layout in 2008. In 2012, the track was given its current name to honor late motorcycle racer Marco Simoncelli, who grew up in the area and ascended to the top levels of the sport.</p> <p>The current Misano layout plays host to everything from Grand Prix motorcycle racing to Formula 4 and numerous sports car championships. Here on iRacing, you'll get to sample five different layouts, ranging from the current Grand Prix and Truck layouts to two historic GP configurations and even a short Club circuit.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/misano","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"misano-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/misano-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":0,"small_image":"misano-small.jpg","track_id":501,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_misano/501-misano-gp/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
