The fifth and most recent design, authored by the internationally recognized Hermann Tilke, clocks in at 2.835 miles (4.563 km) and features 16 turns. Its frontstretch is responsible for nearly a mile of that length, forcing drivers to push for top speed coming off of the final corner, Panasonic, before diving into Turn 1.</p> <p>Since 1967, Fuji Speedway has been a frequent host of prominent endurance races, starting with the Fuji 1000 km that year and evolving into the Fuji 6 Hours in 2012. The track hosted its first Japanese Grand Prix in 1976, and the event returned in 1977, 2007, and 2008. The track has also been a longtime staple of the Japanese national GT and formula series calendars, and its application has been so diverse that it even played host to cycling in the 2020 Summer Olympics.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/fujiinternationalspeedway","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"fujiinternationalspeedway-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/fujiinternationalspeedway-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":9,"small_image":"fujiinternationalspeedway-small.jpg","track_id":444,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_fuji/444-fuji-gp/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
