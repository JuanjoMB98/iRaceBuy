Besides hosting major touring series, it's also the last track in the world to run Supermodifieds as part of its weekly races. Still, there's much more to Oswego than thatâ€”from frequent spots on touring modified, late model, and other open wheel series, to its annual dirt conversion for Super DIRT Week and the Big Block Modifieds of the Super DIRTcar Series, few ovals in America host such a diverse racing program.</p> <p>Oswego's conversion from racing horses to racing cars began in 1951, when the track was converted to a 3/8 mile dirt track. That layout was paved the next year and remained as such until 1961, when it was lengthened to its current 5/8 mile configuration, although a 3/8 mile Mini Oval is still accessible. Oswego began hosting Super DIRT Week in the fall of 2016 and has undergone an annual makeover each year since.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/oswego","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"oswego-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/oswego-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":5,"small_image":"oswego-small.jpg","track_id":518,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_oswego/518-oswego-oval/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
