{"coordinates":"36.2632543,-115.02155","detail_copy":"<p>The Bullring at Las Vegas Motor Speedway is racing's answer to truth in advertising.  Located a stone's throw away from the big 1.5 mile superspeedway that hosts NASCAR's big three national touring championships each year, The Bullring is an asphalt oval that's short on distance (3/8 of a mile) and long on action.</p><p>The Bullring's (relatively) long straights and tight turns make for great wheel-to-wheel racing and plenty of rubbin', but the track's schedule is no less action- packed.  From March through November the track's weekly shows feature NASCAR's Super Late Models, Super Stocks, Bombers and Grand American Modifieds and USLCI Legends, Thunder Cars and Bandoleros with occasional visits by the likes of the Lucas Oil Modifieds and USAC HPD Midgets mixed-in for good measure.  And in contrast to the nearby Las Vegas strip, what happens at The Bullring doesn't always stay at The Bullring.  Just ask Kyle Busch who registered more than two dozen wins at The Bullring as a teenage phenom en route to a hugely successful career in NASCAR's premier series.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/thebullring","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"thebullring-small.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/thebullring-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":10,"small_image":"thebullring-large.jpg","track_id":271,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_bullring/271-bullring/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
