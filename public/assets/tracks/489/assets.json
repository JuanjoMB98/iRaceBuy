{"coordinates":"43.9231800,4.5041730","detail_copy":"<p>Breaking ground in 1970 and opening three years later, Circuit de Lédenon is one of France’s most unique and challenging race circuits. Measuring in at 1.958 miles (3.151 km), the track manages to pack 13 varied corners and plenty of altitude changes into a relatively small space. It also differs from most other major tracks in France in that it runs counterclockwise. The track had played host to French Formula 4 regularly since 2011, and also hosts national GT races.</p> <p>A lap at Lédenon begins with the long, high-speed frontstretch before entering the Triple Gauche, three left-hand corners that lead into the Virage du Pont, a tighter right-hander. After the slow La Carrierrasse left-hander, drivers accelerate through La Courmelle and downhill into the Virage du Camion, before Le Cavalet turns them hard right and uphill once again. After getting through La Servie, drivers accelerate through one more straightaway broken up by smaller corners before La Cuvette sends them back onto the frontstretch.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/circuitdeledenon","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"circuitdeledenon-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/circuitdeledenon-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":14,"small_image":"circuitdeledenon-small.jpg","track_id":489,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_ledenon/489-ledenon/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
