Breaking ground in early 2008 and opening later that year, it has boasted a full calendar of global and national events ever since. Twice the home of the Portuguese Grand Prix, the track has also hosted the 6 Hours of Portimão, numerous TCR events, and various other motorcycle, open wheel, and sports car races in that time.</p> <p>A lap of Portimão is marked by heavy elevation changes throughout its 4.653 km (2.891 mile) layout. These big slopes mix with a varied selection of both tight and sweeping turns to produce one of the most old-school feeling laps out of any circuit to be built in the 2000s. You'll have the chance to sample all of its variations through both its Grand Prix and Moto configurations, each of which are available both with and without chicanes.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/algarve","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"algarve-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/algarve-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":0,"small_image":"algarve-small.jpg","track_id":510,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_algarve/510-algarve-gpchicane/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
