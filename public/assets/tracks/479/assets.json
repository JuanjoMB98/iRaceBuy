One of many tracks worldwide designed by Hermann Tilke, the track hosts a diverse slate of national and international car and motorcycle events, ranging from touring car and GT cars to major feeder open-wheel divisions.</p><p>The 3.321-mile Grand Prix circuit at Aragón boasts 18 turns, as well as two major straightaways—one featuring the start-finish line, and one after the 90-degree Turn 15. The length of the latter depends on the configuration; for cars, it heads toward a sharp hairpin for Turn 16, while the motorcycle layout skips this section for a more gradual Turn 16 that sweeps directly into the frontstretch. Aragón also boasts a smaller National layout that dives into the infield after Turn 2 and brings racers through to the backstretch.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/motorlandaragon","gallery_images":"1,2,3","gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"motorlandaragon-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/motorlandaragon-logo.png","north":"90deg","num_svg_images":13,"small_image":"motorlandaragon-small.jpg","track_id":479,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_aragon/479-aragon-nationalmoto/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
