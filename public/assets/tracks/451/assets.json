Opened in May 1990, the track sits in an ideal spot for racing: not only does its forest terrain provide a scenic backdrop and ideal variation in elevation (nearly 140 feet), but the track's southern location also enables it to stay open for driving experiences for as long as possible each year. From the Porsche Carrera Cup to Gatebil, it's one of Scandinavia's most prominent hosts of professional racing events.</p><p>\r\nAfter two decades in operation, the track received a redesign from world-renowned circuit designer Hermann Tilke. The resulting 2.022-mile (3.254-km), 14-turn circuit is in use not only for professional racing and driving events, but also for driver training and track days, and includes Tilke's signature mix of long straightaways and tight, technical sections. With an extended fleet of both Porsche and Mercedes GT vehicles, it's an ideal training ground for those looking to gain experience in competitive sports cars of all types.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/rudskogenmotorsenter","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"rudskogenmotorsenter-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/rudskogenmotorsenter-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":7,"small_image":"rudskogenmotorsenter-small.jpg","track_id":451,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_rudskogen/451-rudskogen/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
