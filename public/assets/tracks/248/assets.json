{"coordinates":"30.503841,-87.310641","detail_copy":"<p>A half mile, paved oval opened in 1953, Five Flags Speedway takes its name from its proximity to Pensacola, FL, known as the \"City of Five Flags\" in reference to the fact that five governments have ruled the city (Spain, France, Great Britain, the Confederate States of America and the United States of America). Five Flags is one of the fastest \"short\" tracks in America, thanks to its steep (15 degree) banking and wide turns that give the track a nearly circular configuration.</p> <p>Although the track hosted the NASCAR Grand National Series (forerunner of today's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series) in its early days, since 1968 Five Flags has been known as the site of the annual Snowball Derby. Held each December, the Snowball Derby is considered the year's premier Super Late Model event. Past Snowball Derby winners have included Donnie Allison, Darrell Waltrip, Rich Bickle Jr, Kyle Busch, Erik Jones and Chase Elliott. Five Flags Speedway's regular season features Super Late Models, Pro Late Models, Super Stocks, Sportsmen and Bombers every other Friday night from March through October.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/fiveflagsspeedway","gallery_images":"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9","gallery_prefix":"fiveflagsspeedway-gallery","large_image":"fiveflagsspeedway-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/fiveflagsspeedway-logo.png","north":"90deg","num_svg_images":6,"small_image":"fiveflagsspeedway-small.jpg","track_id":248,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_fiveflags/248-fiveflags/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
