{"coordinates":"51.207660, -1.608988","detail_copy":"<p>Hampshire, England's Thruxton Circuit traces its history back to 1950, when the former RAF Thruxton airfield-home base for many key Allied efforts during World War II-first saw use in motorcycle races. The main circuit was established in 1968, following the outline of the airfield's perimeter road. It currently hosts major British touring car and superbike events each summer, as well as series like the F4 British Championship and TCR UK.</p> <p>Befitting a circuit built around active runways, Thruxton is known as “The Fastest Circuit in the UK.” A lap of Thruxton features just 12 turns in its 3.793 km (2.356 mile) layout, and few of them are particularly sharp. While its race lap record is still over a minute, owing to the levels of racing it typically hosts, there's potential for a much faster time in higher-class equipment with its gradual curves. Damon Hill turned a lap of 57.6 seconds with an average speed of over 147 miles per hour in his Williams FW15C in 1993 that serves as the unofficial track record.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/thruxtoncircuit","gallery_images":"1,2,3","gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"thruxtoncircuit-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/thruxtoncircuit-logo.png","north":"90deg","num_svg_images":5,"small_image":"thruxtoncircuit-small.jpg","track_id":532,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_thruxton/532-thruxton/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
