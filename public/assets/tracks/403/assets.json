That mission was successful just one year later, and the event became a staple of the series until 1987. The track was completely rebuilt in the mid-1990s and rechristened the A1-Ring, which enabled it to return to the circuit from 1997 to 2003.</p> <p>After a period of uncertainty that followed the demolition of the grandstands and pit buildings in 2004, circuit owner Red Bull began its reconstruction of the track in late 2008 and gradually added both modern and vintage events over the years, culminating in the return of the Austrian Grand Prix in 2014. In 2020, with the COVID-19 forcing a rework of the schedule, the Red Bull Ring became the first circuit to ever host back-to-back rounds to open a Formula 1 season, as well as the first European venue to host the opening round of the season since 1966.</p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/redbullring","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"redbullring-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/redbullring-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":11,"small_image":"redbullring-small.jpg","track_id":403,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_spielberg/403-spielberg-gp/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
