Global motorsport fans know Magny-Cours best for hosting the French Grand Prix for nearly two decades from 1991 to 2008, where Michael Schumacher became the first-ever driver to win a single Grand Prix eight times at the same circuit in 2006. </p><p>\nLast revised in 2003, Magny-Cours' Grand Prix circuit currently stands at 2.741 miles. Its 17 corners begin with the gradual left-hand Grande Courbe, while other corners are named for fellow current and former Grand Prix circuits like Adelaide, Nurburgring, Estoril, and Imola. The lap finishes with the Complexe du Lyc√©e, a hard right-hand corner followed by a right-left chicane back onto the frontstretch. </p>","detail_techspecs_copy":null,"detail_video":null,"folder":"/img/tracks/circuitdeneversmagnycours","gallery_images":null,"gallery_prefix":null,"large_image":"circuitdeneversmagnycours-large.jpg","logo":"/img/logos/tracks/circuitdeneversmagnycours-logo.png","north":null,"num_svg_images":11,"small_image":"circuitdeneversmagnycours-small.jpg","track_id":463,"track_map":"https://members-assets.iracing.com/public/track-maps/tracks_magnycours/463-magnycours-gp/","track_map_layers":{"background":"background.svg","inactive":"inactive.svg","active":"active.svg","pitroad":"pitroad.svg","start-finish":"start-finish.svg","turns":"turns.svg"}}
