It wasn't until five years later that the 3/8-mile oval was paved, and that's when Lanier began to become really successful.</p> <p>Moderately-banked wide-open turns and fairly short straightaways make NASCAR-sanctioned Lanier National Speedway a good test for all six of the track's weekly racing divisions, among them Pro Late Models, Open-Wheel Modifieds and Legends Cars.</p> <p>Located literally across the highway from the Road Atlanta sports car circuit, in Braselton, GA, it's not unusual on a Saturday evening to find road-racers scattered among the throngs gathered at Lanier to watch the intense racing, no doubt wondering to themselves if they could hack it out there running wheel to wheel, lap after lap.</p> <p>Dale Earnhardt, Darrell Waltrip, Mark Martin, Jeff Gordon, Kevin Harvick, Michael Waltrip, David Stremme, Bobby Labonte and road-racer turned NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series(TM) driver Andy Lally have all competed at Lanier.
